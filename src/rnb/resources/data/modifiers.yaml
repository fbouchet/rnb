# Validation: Human annotators via Amazon Mechanical Turk
#
# Application Formula (multiplicative):
#   modified_value = base_value × (1 + modifier)
#
# Example:
#   "very lazy" where lazy maps to scheme value 0.7:
#   modified = 0.7 × (1 + 0.2) = 0.7 × 1.2 = 0.84
#
#   "slightly ambitious" where ambitious maps to 0.8:
#   modified = 0.8 × (1 + (-0.5)) = 0.8 × 0.5 = 0.4
#
# Value interpretation:
#   +1.0  = doubles intensity (100% increase)
#   +0.5  = 50% increase
#   +0.2  = 20% increase (e.g., "very")
#    0.0  = no change
#   -0.3  = 30% decrease (e.g., "somewhat")
#   -0.5  = 50% decrease (e.g., "slightly")
#   -1.0  = nullifies (would multiply by 0)
#   <-1.0 = inverts polarity (rare, used for near-negators)
