  notes: |
    TIPI measures Emotional Stability (inverse of Neuroticism).
    For RnB compatibility, scores are converted to Neuroticism via:
    neuroticism_score = scale_max + scale_min - emotional_stability_score

instructions: |
  Here are a number of personality traits that may or may not apply to you. 
  Please write a number next to each statement to indicate the extent to which 
  you agree or disagree with that statement. You should rate the extent to which 
  the pair of traits applies to you, even if one characteristic applies more 
  strongly than the other.

scale:
  min: 1
  max: 7
  midpoint: 4.0
  labels:
    1: "Disagree strongly"
    2: "Disagree moderately"
    3: "Disagree a little"
    4: "Neither agree nor disagree"
    5: "Agree a little"
    6: "Agree moderately"
    7: "Agree strongly"

  # Conversion to RnB scale [-1, 1]
  # Formula: rnb_score = (tipi_score - midpoint) / half_range
  # Where: midpoint = 4.0, half_range = 3.0
  # Example: TIPI 7 -> (7-4)/3 = 1.0, TIPI 1 -> (1-4)/3 = -1.0
  rnb_conversion:
    midpoint: 4.0
    half_range: 3.0
    
  # For Neuroticism specifically (inverted from Emotional Stability):
  # neuroticism_rnb = -1 * emotional_stability_rnb
