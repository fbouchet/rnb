  notes: |
    BFI-2-S uses "Negative Emotionality" (equivalent to Neuroticism).
    No inversion needed for RnB compatibility.
    Facet scales have limited reliability with only 2 items each;
    recommended for samples with N >= 400 for facet-level analysis.

instructions: |
  Here are a number of characteristics that may or may not apply to you. 
  For example, do you agree that you are someone who likes to spend time 
  with others? Please write a number next to each statement to indicate 
  the extent to which you agree or disagree with that statement.

scale:
  min: 1
  max: 5
  midpoint: 3.0
  labels:
    1: "Disagree strongly"
    2: "Disagree a little"
    3: "Neutral; no opinion"
    4: "Agree a little"
    5: "Agree strongly"
