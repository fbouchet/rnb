"""
Integration tests for RnB framework with actual LLMs.

These tests validate the complete pipeline:
1. Personality state definition
2. Influence operator activation
3. LLM query with behavioral modifications
4. Measurable behavioral differences

Tests use local models (Ollama) to avoid API costs during development.
